A camera that follows people's movements

## Summary

This work explores the surveillance in Xinjiang. The composition of the picture is based on a photo I have taken in Xinjiang. In the upper right corner of the screen I programmed an analog camera which will follow the audience's movement.

## Component Parts
Image coded as a backgroud which shows the location of this image
Surveillance cameras follows the audience's movement
Face detection system

## Challenges

Because the recognition system is based on the model training done by others, the movement of the camera is not so accurate. Because I am positioning based on the recognition frame, and there is no way to be recognized when the person is in the corner,the camera has no way to move to the corner.
